# hands-on

## Purpose

This repository is made for feeling out the GitHub functions: 
- permission system
- cloning possibilities
- branch management.

Corrections from other contributors will be rejected.

## The road so far
To bring this repository to life, I made the following steps:

1. Logged in the  github.com.
	1. I had to change the password as I forgot it.
	2. Generated a good password as my go-to option was rejected by the GitHub.
2. Created my first repository via UI.
	1. Generated a name.
	2. Filled in a small description. 
	3. Checked the "create readme.md" option just in case.
